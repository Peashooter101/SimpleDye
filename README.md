# SimpleDye

Did you ever feel like dyeing leather armor was a pain? Of course you didn't! That is why I made a solution for it anyway!

## Commands

`/sd` `/simpledye` `/dye`

`/sd basic <color>`

- Choose from a wide array of colors provided to you by the DyeColors Enum!
- Requires the `sd.dye.basic` or `sd.dye.*` permission ~~or you can be op, but we don't talk about that~~.

`/sd rgb <hex>`

- Or decide you are too fancy for that and need specific color mixing!
- Supports `RRGGBB` format or `#RRGGBB` but not #RGB / RGB format because you can type out 6 characters, don't be lazy...
- Requires the `sd.dye.rgb` or `sd.dye.*` permission ~~or you can be op, but we- never mind, I think you get the point.~~.

`/sdreload`

- Reloads the configuration file
